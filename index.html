        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi!! My name is Samir Sanyal. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from Indiana University Bloomington. Prior to graduate school I used to work as a Cloud Engineer for one of the leading company in the domain of healthcare. I have working experience in AWS and Azure. I have also worked in DevOps and cloud security. Iâ€™m currently diving deep into my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at Indiana University Bloomington while actively seeking summer internships for 2025. My journey began with a Bachelorâ€™s in Electronics and Computer from VIT where I first discovered my passion for technology. Since then, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work as a System Engineer at Dr Lal PathLabs where I tackled enterprise issues related to Azure and AWS. It was here that I learned the ins-and-outs of cloud security and identity access management (IAM), all while executing cost optimization strategies that made a real difference. During my time at Dr Lal PathLabs, I was fortunate enough to be part of projects that not only challenged me but also fueled my curiosity about cloud computing and big data. One of my proudest moments was successfully resolving complex issues that improved our cloud infrastructure's efficiency by 30%. Itâ€™s this kind of problem-solving that excites meâ€”finding innovative solutions in the ever-evolving tech landscape. Before stepping into the world of cloud engineering, I interned at CoreEL Technologies where I explored MATLAB for image processing and machine learning concepts. This experience opened my eyes to the potential of machine learning algorithms in real-world applications. I loved experimenting with spatial transformations and Otsu's Methodâ€”it felt like being an artist with a digital canvas! Outside of my academic pursuits, Iâ€™m an avid reader who enjoys writing about technology trends. Whether itâ€™s exploring new ML algorithms or sharing insights on cloud advancements through content writing, I find joy in connecting ideas with others. I believe that sharing knowledge is just as important as acquiring it. Iâ€™m eager to connect with like-minded professionals who share my enthusiasm for technology! If youâ€™re looking for someone passionate about DevOps or machine learningâ€”or if you have insights to shareâ€”feel free to reach out via email!</p>
